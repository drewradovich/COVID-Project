This project was performed for as part of a practicum aimed at gaining clinical experience and insight into how data is used in clinical healthcare.

For this project, I used global data provided by the Centers for Disease Control on the COVID-19 virus. This data includes number of deaths, total case numbers,
number of individuals vaccinated, number of new cases daily, and test positivity. The data set also includes demographic data including country, continent, population size, 
and personal demographic data such as age, tobacco use, and previous risk of heart condition.

The goal of the project was to perform an exploratory data analysis and identify key trends in COVID-19 numbers, specifically relating to death counts and vaccine rates and
effectiveness. Vaccine effectiveness was determined by comparing the total percent population vaccinated against the total number of deaths resulting from COVID-19, per country.
This analysis also identified the countries with the highest infection and death rates so that comparisons may be drawn between healthcare infrastructures in each country and their
handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
